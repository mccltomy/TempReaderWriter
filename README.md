# TempReaderWriter

Summary: The project was to read from a list of temperatures in fahrenheit and then output a file with the temperatures converted to celsius. 
I implemented the reading and writing component well getting an output file that was in line with what was requested.
I could do better by giving myself more time to test different ideas and ways to get the final output.
It was a little challenging getting the while loop correct. I overcome this by researching how while loop logic is properly implemented, sitting back thinking of what I was trying to achieve, as well as utilizing the information provided in the course.
Gaining a deeper understanding of OOP and getting better with coding logic/tools/resources.
The program itself is farily simple and really just requires the user to have the input file properly pathed so that it can be read and write an output file.
